# 0. Setup 
- These instruction assume that you have completed all the installation and setup steps requrired.
- To recreate the results in this assignment, download the package and unzip into a folder.
- Move into the package `assignment1_sparab`.
- To render your first mesh run the following command, the results will be stored in the images folder.
- **Result:** `images/cow_render.jpg`

![Cow Render](../images/cow_render.jpg)

**Command:**
`python -m code.render_mesh`

# 1. Practicing with Cameras
- In this section we will try to create 2 effects 1. 360 Camera View and 2. Dolly Zoom


## 1.1 360 Renders

Using **pytorch3d.renderer.cameras.look_at_view_transform** we get the camera poses such that the camera is facing the object. We change the azimuth
in small increments which gives the illusion of the camera moving around the object. We get multiple images of the object from different camera angles.
We then stitch the images together to form a gif.

- **Result:** `images/render_360.gif`

![Cow Render 360 View](../images/render_360.gif)


**Command:**
`python -m code.render_360`

## 1.2 Dolly Zoom
The Dolly Zoom effeect is created by changing the distance of the camera from object while changing the FOV such that the object appears to be of a constant size.
This is done by utilizing the formula below.

\begin{equation}
distance = \frac{width}{2tan(\frac{fov}{2})}
\end{equation}

- **Result:** `images/dolly.gif`

![Dolly Zoom Effect](../images/dolly.gif)

**Command:**
`python -m code.dolly_zoom`


# 2. Practicing Meshes

## 2.1 Tetrahedron

- We will be creating a custom tetrahedron shape. The shape is stored in a form of vertices and faces in the `data/tetrahedron.obj` file
- We will be rendering this file and viewing it in 360.
- **Result:** `images/tetrahedron_render_360.gif`
- **We will be using 4 vertices and 4 triangle faces to form a tetrahedron.**

![Tetrahedron 360 View](../images/tetrahedron_render_360.gif)

**Command:**
`python -m code.render_360_tetrahedron`

## 2.2 Cube
- We will be creating a custom cube shape. The shape is stored in a form of vertices and faces in the `data/cube.obj` file
- We will be rendering this file and viewing it in 360.
- **Result:** `images/cube_render_360.gif`

- **We will be using 8 vertices and 12 triangle faces to form a cube.**

![Cube 360 View](../images/cube_render_360.gif)

**Command:**
`python -m code.render_360_cube`

# 3. Retexturing Meshes

- In this section we will be adding a color gradient to the cow rendering and viewing it in a 360 view.
- **Result:** `images/render_360_color.gif`

- **The colors chosen are color1=[0.0, 1.0, 1.0] and color2=[0.0, 0.0, 1.0]**
- It starts with a shade of green & blue (emerald) and then ends with deep blue.

![Color Gradient 360 View](../images/render_360_color.gif)

**Command:**
`python -m code.render_360_color`


# 4. Camera Transformation

- Here we will be doing camera transformations to get various views of the object.
- **Result:** 
        + `images/transform_cow_1.jpg`
        + `images/transform_cow_2.jpg`
        + `images/transform_cow_3.jpg`
        + `images/transform_cow_4.jpg`
        + `images/transform_cow_5.jpg`

The fixed Rotation is a identity matrix, so it does not contribute to any rotation and the fixed translation matrix is a having a 
translation of 3 along the Z-axis.

In order to get the results given in the assignment we need to have the following relative Rotation and Translation.

The relative Rotation need to be rotated 90 Anti ClockWise along Z-axis.

![90 Anti-ClockWise about Z axis](../images/transform_cow_1.jpg)

The relative Rotation need to be rotated 90 Anti ClockWise along Y-axis and the relative translation has to be adjusted to move by 3 units
along the X-axis and Z-axis.

![90 Anti-ClockWise about Y axis](../images/transform_cow_2.jpg)

The relative translations has to move further along Z-axis by 3 units.

![Translation along Z axis](../images/transform_cow_3.jpg)

The relative translations has to move further along X-axis by 0.5 units.

![Translation along X axis](../images/transform_cow_4.jpg)

This is a custom orientation where the relative Rotation need to be rotated 45 ClockWise along Y-axis.

![45 ClockWise about Z axis](../images/transform_cow_5.jpg)



**Command:**
`python -m code.camera_transforms`

# 5. Generic 3D Representation

## 5.1 Point Clouds from RGB-D (Plant)

- We will be using a point cloud representation with color values and viewing it in 3D.
- We will then combine multiple point clouds to get a dense 3D visulization in 360 view.
- **Result:** `images/render_360_plant_1.gif`,`images/render_360_plant_2.gif`,`images/render_360_plant_3.gif`

![Plant View 1](../images/render_360_plant_1.gif)![Plant View 2](../images/render_360_plant_2.gif)![Combine View](../images/render_360_plant_3.gif)
**Command:**
`python -m code.render_plant`

## 5.2 Parametric Representation (Torus)

- We will be using the parametric form of Torus to render a 3D point cloud using sampling and view it in 3D.
- **Result:** `images/torus_parametric_render_360.gif`

![Torus Parametric](../images/torus_parametric_render_360.gif)

**Command:**
`python -m code.render_torus --render parametric`

## 5.3 Implicit Representation (Torus)

- We will be using the implicit form of Torus to render a 3D mesh and view it in 3D.
- **Result:** `images/torus_implicit_render_360.gif`

![Torus Implicit](../images/torus_implicit_render_360.gif)

**Command:**
`python -m code.render_torus --render implicit`


**Mesh v/s Point Cloud**

Mesh rendering involves techiniques like Marching Cube algorihtm which allows genereatinon of complex shapes
, but can be slower due to the iteraive nature of the algorithm. The memory usae is higher for complex shapes 
as it requires to store volumetric representation.

Point Clouds rendering are faster and memory-efficient and are useful for generatin accurate 
representation of 3D surfaces with dense point rpresentations.
